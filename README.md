# Adam's UNIX shell environment

This is my collection of UNIX shell configuration files and utilities.
These days I only use them with zsh and bash on Linux, but in the
past I also used them on various Solaris and FreeBSD machines, and
for the most part they should work on any POSIX-oriented UNIX.

## Contents

* Configuration files for zsh
    * [`.zshrc`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/blob/master/.zshrc) - config for interactive instances only
    * [`.zshenv`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/blob/master/.zshenv) - config for non-interactive *and* interactive instances
    * [`.zsh/`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/tree/master/.zsh/) hierarchy, including:
        * [`.zsh/functions/`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/tree/master/.zsh/functions/) - various handy interactive and completion functions
        * [`.zsh/accounts.d/`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/tree/master/.zsh/accounts.d/) - for configuring completion of (user, host) pairs
        * [`.zsh/users.d/`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/tree/master/.zsh/users.d/) - for configuring completion of users

* Configuration files for bash
    * [`.bashrc`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/blob/master/.bashrc) - config for interactive instances only
    * [`.bash_profile`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/blob/master/.bash_profile) - config for interactive "login shell" instances only
    * [`.bashenv`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/blob/master/.bashenv) - config for non-interactive *and* interactive instances

* Configuration files to be shared by any Bourne-compatible shell
    * [`.shared_env`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/blob/master/.shared_env) - config for non-interactive *and* interactive instances
    * [`.shared_rc`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/blob/master/.shared_rc) - config for interactive instances only

* Mechanism for automatically switching between shells. <br/>
  Useful for when you do not have root privileges and want to run a
  locally compiled version of `zsh` rather than a system-wide shell.
  See:
    * [`.switch_shell`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/blob/master/.switch_shell)
    * [`.ns`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/blob/master/.ns)

* Perl library [`lib/perl5/Sh.pm`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/blob/master/lib/perl5/Sh.pm) providing some handy native Perl
  replacements for shell-like operations.

* Hook-runner mechanism for building composite configuration out of
  multiple files in a [`foo.d/`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/tree/master/foo.d/) hierarchy.  For more information see:
    * [`doc/ConfigHooks.org`](https://github.com/aspiers/shell-env/blob/master/doc/ConfigHooks.org)

      a single configuration file which can then be consumed by an external
      program such as `ssh`, `mutt`, `crontab` etc.

## <a name="install">INSTALLATION</a>

This repository is designed to be [stowed](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
directly into your home directory:

    git clone git://github.com/aspiers/shell-env.git
    stow -d . -t ~ shell-env

However if you only want to cherry-pick bits and pieces then you can
easily just copy or symlink them in manually.  Just be aware that some
of the files depend on other files, especially the shell configuration
files.
