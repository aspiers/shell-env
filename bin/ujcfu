# Note that we omit --user here, because for some weird reason it
# doesn't always work with --user.  E.g. once on ionian I saw it
# showing "No journal files were found." until I restarted
# systemd-journald.service.  This *might* have been because it was
# started without /var/log/journal existing, therefore the default of
# Storage=auto in /etc/systemd/journald.conf chose volatile storage
# (see journald.conf(5) man page).

# where Poettering explains that persistent logging is needed for this
# to work.  However he also seemed to suggest that membership of the
# systemd-journal group should have been sufficient, but apparently it
# wasn't in the above scenario.
#
# Either way it seems that it always works with just --user-unit.
