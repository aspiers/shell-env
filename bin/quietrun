Usage: quietrun [ -m | --merge ] <command> [ <args> ... ]

If the merge option is specified, stdout and stderr are merged into
stdout, but the output order is preserved.  Otherwise they kept
separate, but output from stderr only appears after output from stdout.

The exit code from the command is preserved.
